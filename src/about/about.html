            <h2>My coding background</h2>
            <p>I have been passionate about creating computer programs since primary school, it all started with the knowledge that creating my own games isn't impossible.
                In roughly year 7, I started making basic games with "scratch", all of which are sadly lost to time at this point.</p> 
                
                <p>Once I got to high school I found the drag-and-drop approach to "GameMaker 8.1" and created a very basic game "Virus Attack".
                It wasn't until I discovered "GameMaker: Studio" that I coded for the first time, my first games can still be found on my
                <a target="_blank" href="https://gamejolt.com/@loopypew">GameJolt</a> account, "Necrophobia" being the game I worked the most on (looking back at it, it's embarrassing). 
                After creating some basic games in the Gamemaker native "GML" I started to develop websites, very primitive but websites no less.</p>

                <p>My first real project was for the high school I went to, Motueka High, my assessment was to create a website, advertising the sports day coming up, this is where I 
                discovered that I don't like designing websites. Sometime after, I learnt about the concepts of backend development,
                finally, a style of code that meant I didn't have to design anything! apart from the systems, database, networking, 
                frameworks and everything else that goes with it of course, but hey, at least I didn't have to work with the presentation.
