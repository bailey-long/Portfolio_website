                    <h1>Old School RuneScape</h1>
                    <p>Runescape is a game I have been playing off and on for years. I like the game so much due to how free it is, there is no goal 
                        except to better yourself and achieve your own personal goals. It's often seen as the game where you spend hundreds of hours doing the same
                        thing and while not completely untrue, there is an incredible amount of content meaning you could play this game for an absurd number of years before
                        running out of things to do.</p>

                    <h1>Magic the Gathering</h1>
                    <p>I started playing this incredible (and expensive) card game in high school. Magic is a card game about multidimensional conflict, cataclysmic threats
                        to the multiverse, and the struggle of the planeswalkers to keep said multiverse from falling apart. The variation of play styles is what makes 
                        this game so fun, and the fact that you can play it with friends or strangers.</p>

                    <h1>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h1>
                    <p>Where do I begin with D&D, most people know it as "That board game from Stanger Things", D&D is a game with no limits, a game where you can be a powerful
                        wizard fighing off even more powerful monsters, a lighthearted bard that lives for the nightlife or a simple baker that makes a living from a small shop in the capital city.
                        I have been playing D&D since I was 14 and have met my closest friends through it.</p>

                    <p>This one should go without saying. I have been coding since highschool, never anything substantial in that time but I have made a good
                        number of games and websites. I am currently studying to become a web developer and I am loving every minute of it.</p>

                    <p>Did you ever see those scenes in tv shows where a character gets angry because someone calls their little army men "toys", yeah im that guy
                        I mostly paint minis for Warhammer and D&D as I love to see armies and battlefields come together on a table.
                        Painting minis is a very relaxing hobby but I often struggle to find time for it due to how time consuming
                        it can be.

                    <p>Often when im playing games or painting, I have a series of anime on the side, I have lost count of the amount of series I have seen but I can easily name 
                        my favourites.
