            <h2>My coding background</h2>
            <p>I have been passionate about creating computer programs since primary school, it all started with the knowledge that creating my own games isn't impossible.
                In year 7 I started making basic games in "scratch", all of which are sadly lost to time at this point. Once I got to high school I found the drag and drop approach to
                "GameMaker 8.1", It wasn't untill I discovered "GameMaker: Studio" that I coded for the first time, my first games can still be found on my
                <a href="https://gamejolt.com/@loopypew">GameJolt</a> account, "Necrophobia" being the game I worked the most on. 
                After creating some basic games in the Gamemaker native "GML" I started to develop websites, very primative but websites no less.
